;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	  <SM16>	12/21/93	ged		Rolled back everything from the previous checkin except minimal
;									support for Yeager and Blackbird sound primitives.  Additional
;									Blackbird sound primitives will be rolled in when ready.
;	  <SM15>	12/13/93	PN		Roll in KAOs and Horror changes to support Malcom and AJ
;									machines.
;	  <SM14>	 10/1/93	JDR		Rolled in the InstallSndPrimitives routine from Reality patches.
;									System Software has SndPrimitives patches that patch certain
;									machines that were never rolled into the ROM. Why wasn't any of
;									this code rolled in previously? Hope it works! I did roll in
;									TIMInputSelect patch. I think ElsieInputSelect might still be
;									wrong.
;	  <SM13>	 8/20/93	chp		Sound interrupt primitives all referred to the ASC, which was a
;									misnomer. This has been updated to reflect the appropriate level
;									of abstraction in InterruptHandlers.a.
;	  <SM12>	  8/4/93	JDR		SoundPriv.a was changed to SoundPrivate.a
;	  <SM11>	 5/25/93	joe		Added vector table & stub routines for PDM.
;	  <SM10>	 1/14/93	PN		Add SndCntlMacIIsi table for Macsi sound init.
;	   <SM9>	 12/5/92	SWC		Added routines to do sound hardware initialization for
;									StartInit. Added a table for DJMEMC-based machines because the
;									sound init code does more stuff than the standard Batman code.
;									Moved InitSndHW, InitSndNoRAM, InitSoundHW here from
;									StartInit.a.
;	   <SM8>	 12/3/92	EH		Zero out entries for DFAC-related routines in the Blackbird
;									table (for now).
;	   <SM7>	12/01/92	HY		Changed default value for DFAC initialization for LCR/LCII.
;	   <SM6>	 12/1/92	EH		Added table for Blackbird.
;	   <SM5>	11/30/92	SWC		Updated to latest Horror. Added in build conditionals.
;	   <H23>	 11/9/92	ag		Added save of d2 in baselevel inputselect routine. The routine
;									was trashing d2.
;	   <SM4>	 11/6/92	rab		Roll in Horror changes. Comments follow:
;	   <H22>	10/15/92	NJV		Changed the Vail InputSelect and SetVol primitives so that the
;									UserVolume variable is treated correctly with the new scheme of
;									Volume control on Vail.
;	   <H21>	 9/10/92	NJV		Added new SndCntlVail table that controls volume via DFAC rather
;									than the standard ASIC volume control. Added VailInputSelect,
;									changed SonoraInputSelect to call on to InputSelect rather than
;									SonoraNewInputSelect.
;	   <H20>	 7/14/92	ag		Removed redundent routine adjustautosleep.
;	   <H19>	 7/13/92	ag		Added DartPlayThru and DartQueryInput routines. Added changes to
;									disable playthru if input select is internal mic otherwise we
;									get HORRible feedback.
;	   <H18>	 6/29/92	GMR		Added modem sound support for DB-Lite.
;	   <H17>	  6/3/92	NJV		Changed SonoraInputSelect to enable Sonora to Play and Record
;									simultaneously.
;	   <H16>	 6/03/92	HY		Make LC use same sound vector table as Apollo. Add label SndCntlElsie.
;	   <H15>	 5/19/92	ag		Fixed bugs with DartInputSelect.
;	   <H14>	  5/8/92	djw		Modify DartDFACInit to not use low mem to get DecoderInfo ptr
;	   <H13>	  5/7/92	ag		Added a new table for dartanian. Moved all the tables to the end
;									due to an assembler problem ??
;	   <H12>	05/06/92	jmp		Just added a comment to the EgretDFACInit routine; no code was
;									changed.
;	   <SM3>	  9/9/92	RB		Added a Sound control vector table for LC. (Same as for Classic
;									II (Apollo)).
;	   <SM2>	 5/21/92	RB		Making changes for Cyclone. Change history is below: some
;									comments may be duplicated due to the Pandora/Horror history.
;									<P11> 5/13/92 KW (djw,H14) Modify DartDFACInit to not use low
;									mem to get DecoderInfo ptr (ag,H13) Added a new table for
;									dartanian. Moved all the tables to the end due to an assembler
;									problem ?? (jmp,H12) Just added a comment to the EgretDFACInit
;									routine; no code was changed. <P10> 4/16/92 KW (SWC, H11)
;									Modified the DFAC send routine for DBLite to send the DFAC
;									command byte and a byte specifying the input source.
;									(NJV,H10)Changed SonoraDFACInit to reverse the order of bits
;									it's sending, so that equate can be in DFAC order <P9> 03/23/92
;									jmp (jmp,H9) Moved the SonoraDFACInit and SonoraInputSelect
;									routines so that the Horror ROM map lines up with Zydeco’s. <P8>
;									03/22/92 jmp Put back <P6>. <P7> 3/19/92 FU Rolled back changes
;									in <P6>. <P6> 3/18/92 FU (NJV,H8) Added SonoraDFACInit,
;									SonoraInputSelect, and updated table for Sonora-based machines.
;									<P5> 02/21/92 jmp Added a fake SoundPrimitives table for
;									Cyclone. <P4> 02/07/92 jmp (jmp,H7/BG,Z16) Changed
;									EclipseInputSelect to call ReGenSoundInt after the final
;									VIA2[vBufB] reference is made. Added ReGenSoundInt. Also, moved
;									the Sonora table to the end of the file to make the
;									TERROR/Zydeco ROM map line up with HORROR’s. <P3> 1/15/92 RP
;									Added Cyclone sound stub (that will never work). <P2> 01/13/92
;									jmp (SWC,H6) Found it's better if A0 points to a parameter block
;									before calling _PMgrOp in DBLiteDFACSend.
;		 <1>	 5/17/92	kc		first checked in
;	   <SM0>	  5/2/92	kc		Roll in Horror. Comments follow:
;	   <H11>	 4/13/92	SWC		Modified the DFAC send routine for DBLite to send the DFAC
;									command byte and a byte specifying the input source.
;	   <H10>	 3/25/92	NJV		Changed SonoraDFACInit to reverse the order of bits it's
;									sending, so that equate can be in DFAC order
;		<H9>	03/23/92	jmp		Moved the SonoraDFACInit and SonoraInputSelect routines so that
;									the Horror ROM map lines up with Zydeco’s.

;									Sonora-based machines.
;		<H7>	01/27/92	jmp		(BG,Z16) Changed EclipseInputSelect to call ReGenSoundInt after
;									the final VIA2[vBufB] reference is made. Added ReGenSoundInt.
;									Also, moved the Sonora table to the end of the file to make the
;									TERROR/Zydeco ROM map line up with HORROR’s.
;		<H6>	  1/6/92	SWC		Found it's better if A0 points to a parameter block before
;									calling _PMgrOp in DBLiteDFACSend.
;		<H5>	12/16/91	HJR		Add primitives for Dartanian.
;		<H4>	 12/4/91	CCH		Added sound information for Vail and Carnation.

;	  Pre-HORROR ROM comments begin here.
; ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
;		<15>	  7/8/91	djw		Take out debugger statement that I left in.
;		<14>	  7/8/91	djw		Undid <t13> and made spike and eclipse not force AGC on in the
;									input select.
;		<13>	 6/27/91	HJR		& AG, AGCInputSelect still needs to be used in Spike and
;									Eclipses InputSelect.
;		<12>	 6/25/91	ag		(djw) Fix bug in EclipseInputSelect were you can never change
;									the input source.
;		<11>	 6/24/91	ag		added code to disable auto sleep when a sound source is enabled.
;									Changed AGCcontrol to use AGCoff instead of TCAoff.
;		<10>	 6/24/91	HJR		Added appropriate WITH statements since pmCommand and Sleepq are
;									now records.
;		 <9>	 6/13/91	djw		Disable interrupts around critical code sections. Make
;									InputSelect routine return old source.
;		 <8>	 5/31/91	djw		Fix bug in DB-Lite DFAC initialization due to value change
;									(can't use MOVEQ)
;		 <7>	 5/23/91	HJR		Added include to PowerPrivEqu.a.
;		 <6>	 5/10/91	djw		Add new hardware recommondations for DFAC settings to lessen
;									noise leakage. Roll in SWC's DBLite additions plus code
;									optimizations. Changed all "jsrTBL" macro calls to not need to
;									pass a register in. Added padding to end of file, added new
;									Eclipse input select routine for new VIA bits MUX.
;		 <5>	 3/18/91	djw		Changed TIM to use same routines as Spike for EVT3 hardware.
;									Added Apollo support.  Added new sound primitive routines and
;									fixed bugs in InputSelect for Eclipse.
;		 <4>	 2/18/91	djw		Have Eclipse DFAC routines always leave AGC enabled.
;		 <3>	 2/18/91	djw		Correct relative table offsets for Spike and Eclipse. Corrected
;									DFAC bit on TIM from 6 to 5 (thanks to KIP). Improved DFAC TIM
;									and VIA2 routines to init clock to known state.
;		 <2>	 2/15/91	djw		Add Scott Smyers changes to DFAC Init routines: use DecoderInfo
;									record and clean up register use and equates. Make tables
;									addresses relative, will create separate entry points for
;									Eclipse, Elsie, and Erickson DFAC Init. Re-write Egret/DFAC
;									routines.
;		 <1>	 1/24/91	HJR		First check in.
